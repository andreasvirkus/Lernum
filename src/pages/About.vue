    <h3>Trying to answer what Lernum is about in a few words or maybe more.</h3>

    <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> A PWA + desktop app that brings the free coding resources
      and tech-related study material to the user in a readable fashion.</p>

    <p><strong>I-care-a-bit</strong> version: Lernum is a web (and desktop) app that
      allows you to auth with GitHub (..and Google/Facebook/Twitter?) and gather
      valuable learning resources (podcasts, conference videos, articles, tutorials,
      e-books, etc.), read/view/listen to them, rate them and also discover new
      resources based on previous preferences.</p>

    <p>There'll soon be a convenient discovery, rating and sorting system. The main focus
      is a beautiful/clean/sleek reading or watching mode to focus on consuming the
      learning material.</p>
